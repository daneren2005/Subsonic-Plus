This is to be a fork which closely follows the main Subsonic trunk.  Only minor bug fixes and changes will be allowed.

Differences from 5.3 (mine):
Fixed mixed content error when changing cover art

Deployment issues:
Clean maven repo cache since it grabs old rest-api version (rm -Rf /home/user/.m2/)
Remove old jetty since we are not updating version manually (rm -Rf /var/subsonic/jetty/\$\{buildNumber\}/)
